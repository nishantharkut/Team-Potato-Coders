# Quick Solution for PayU Website Requirement

## Immediate Solution (Choose One)

### Option 1: Select "No" in PayU Form (Try This First!)

1. **Change the radio button** from "Yes" to "No"
2. The website URL field should disappear
3. Complete the signup
4. You can add website later or use payment links

**This is the easiest solution!** PayU allows merchants without websites to use payment links.

### Option 2: Deploy Your App (5 Minutes - Recommended)

If "No" doesn't work, quickly deploy your app:

#### Quick Deploy to Vercel:

```bash
# 1. Make sure your code is on GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push origin main

# 2. Go to https://vercel.com and sign in with GitHub
# 3. Click "Import Project"
# 4. Select your repository
# 5. Click "Deploy" (takes 2-3 minutes)
# 6. You'll get a URL like: https://your-app.vercel.app
# 7. Use this URL in PayU signup form
```

**That's it!** Your app is live and you have a URL for PayU.
